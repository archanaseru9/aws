# route 53:
- scale resource effeciently using route amazon 53
- amazon route 53 is a DNS service that gives developers an efficeient way to connect users to internet applications without any downtime
- AMAZON ROUTE 53 is highly available and scalable domain name system (DNS) web service
- route 53 performs 3 main functions in any combinations
-   1 . if website need name , route 53 register name for the website(domain name)
-   2. route 53 helps to connect the browser with the website or web application when user enters the domain name
    3. route 53 checks the health of resource by sending automated request over the internet to resource
  # benifits:
  - high scalable
  -  reliable
  -  easy to use
  -  cose effective
# # types of routing:
 # routing policy:
 - simple routing : simple routing allows to configure DNS with no special route 53 routing . it routes traffic to single resource Ex-webserver to website
 - with simple routing , multiple recordds with same name cannot be created but,multiple values can be specified in the same record
   # failover routing:
   - routes traffic to resource when resource is healthy or to different resource when the previous resource is unhealthy
   -  the records can route traffic to anything from amazon s3 bucket as website  to complex tree of records
   # geolocation routing:
   - routes the resources that based on geographic location of users
   -  it localize the content and presents part or the entire website in the language of user
   -  geographic locations are specified by continent,by country,or by state in the united state
   # Geoproximity routing:
   - -routes traffic to resources based on geographic location of user and their resources
   -  there is option to route more or less to given resource by specifying a value know as bias
   -   bias shirnks or  expands based on the traffic location of the resource
#  latency based routing:
- if website has to be installed or hosted across the multiple AWS regions , then latency routing policy is used
-  it improves performance for the user by serving their request  from the AWS  region that provided the lowest latency
-   we need to create latency records for the resources in multiple AWS regions
  # multi value answer routing:
  - configure route 53 to return multiple values in response to  DNS queries
  - it also checks the health of resources and return the multiple values only for the healthy resources
  - it has ability to return multiple health checkable IP addresses to improve availability and load balancing
# weighted routing policy:
- routes multiple resources with single doamin name or subdomain name and control the traffic is route to each resource
- it is useful load balancing and testing new version of software
  # route 53 key features:
  - traffic flow: it routes end users to the enpoint that should provide the best user experience
  - domain registration: select the domain names and register them with the AWS console
  - health checks: it monitors health and performance of application
  - weighted round robin load balancing: it spreads traffic b/w several services via round robin
 
  ## statis website hosting
  -- create s3 bucket and upload the documents in s3 bucket
  -- create rouet 53 and buy domain and cread recod and create alias and give the s3 bucket details
