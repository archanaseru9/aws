# S3:
# cloud storage:
- cloud storage provides a webservice where your data can be  stored,accessed and easily backed up by user over the internet.
-  pay for what you use  or pay monthly bases
-  this are relaible
- secure, scalable

  # types:
  - S3
  - EBS like C,D drive- access only system
  - EFS. shared file system..shared system. share by multiple system. from clud system or on primeses
  -  Glacier; Archival . keep the data in low cost
  -  storage gateway  : move the data from local to cloud  environment. It will keep the data locally as wel as accessblile in cloud env.
  -  snowball: data import and export system , but it is hardware, move the date to AWs .AWS Snowball is a data transfer service that uses a physical device sent by Amazon.
  -  Snow edge : AWS Snowball Edge is a type of Snowball device with on-board storage and compute power for select AWS capabilities. Snowball Edge can process data locally and run edge-computing workloads in addition to transferring data between your local environment and the AWS Cloud or the AWS Cloud and your local environment.
  -  AWS Snowmobile: is a data transfer service designed to move very large amounts of data, at the Exabyte scale, to Amazon storage services. A Snowmobile is a standard 45-foot shipping container filled with mass-storage AWS Snowball devices, together storing up to 100 PB (petabytes). The container is pulled by a semi-trailer truck.
# S3: storage techniqe
- object storage: store things, you can directly access from interenet. you no need to install anything
- block storage : need to be attached to instance, cant directly access.. we can install someting in it .
- S3 is an object based storage. we can access from internet but we cant install anything in S3
-  S3(simple storage service) provides object storage which is built for storing and recovering any amount of information or data from anywhere over the internet. data can be  store upto 5 terabytes in size.
-   basically desingned to store logs,code
-    it provides 99.9% durability and 99.9% availability.
-   s3 is  low cost, scalability ,availabilty ,security,duravlility, cost flexible,simple data transfer
  # bucket and objects in S3
 - object consists of data,key (assigned name) and meta data
 -  bucket stores objects
 -  when data is added to the bucket , amazon s3 created unique version ID and allocates it to the object
 -     object: folder/object.png (key(name),version ID)
 -     bucket: simplilearn
 - when files are uploaded to the bucket , the user will specify the type of s3 storage class to be used for those specific objects
 -  later, users can define features to the bucket like bucket like bucket policy,lifecycle policies,version control etc. 
  # bucket & objects: 
  - when files are uploaded to the bucket,thr user will specify the type of S3 storage class to be used for those specific objects
  - Later, user can define features to the bucket like bucket policy,lifecycle policies, versioning control etc.
# storage classes in S3:
- amazon s3 standard for frequent data access. suitable for use cases where latency should be low . Ex: Frequently accessed the data will be data of students attendance ,which should be retrived quickly
- amazon s3 standard for infrequent data access: can be used where data is long lived and less frequently access.ex: student academic record will not be needed on daily basis,but if they have any requirement , their details should be retrived frequently .
- Amazon Galcier: can be used where data has to be archived and high perforamnace is not required . Ex: ex-students old records. like admission fee will not be required on daily basis and even if it is necessary ,low latency required.
- One zone -IA storage class: can be used where data is infrequently accessed and stored in a single region ex: students report card is not frequently used but store in single availability region 

- Amazon S3 standard reduced redundency storage: suitable for use case where the data is non critical and reproduced quickly . Ex: books in library are non critical data and can be replaced if lost

# # Features of S3:
- in lifecycle management, Amazon S3 applies set of rules that define actions to group of objects
-   with this action , you can choose to move objects to another storage class
-  # Transion actions : Mode object to one storage object to other storage object-: you can configure S3 to move data between various storage classes on  a defined schedule.
-      EX: 
-        s3 standard ----------30 days----> S3 infrequent access -----60days----> Glacier
-        Transion Actio : life management helps you to automatically migrate  your data to lower cost  storage as your data ages
- # Expiration Action:
- Here, S3 removes all the objects in the bucket when a specified date or time period in the objects life time reached
## Fetature- Bucket policies:
- bucket policy is an IAM policy where you can allow and deny permission to your amazon S3 resource.
- With bucket policy , you can also define secuirty rules that apply to more than one file with in a bucket.
- For ex: If you don not want a user to access the Simplilearn bucket , with the help of JSOn script you can set permissions
## Fetature- Data Protection :
- Amazon S3 provodes IT teams a highly durable,protected and scalable infrastructure designed for object storage
- it referes to  protection of data while its being transmitted and at rest
-  Data encryption can happen in two ways:
-  1.client side encryption- Data encryption is rest
-  2.Server side encryption - Data encryption in motion 
-   Expiration actions
